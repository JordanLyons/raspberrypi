My notes about Raspberry Pi projects

I got a Raspberry Pi Canakit: http://www.canakit.com/quick-start/pi

I'm just playing with it and keeping track of my projects.

I completed "Getting Started with Minecraft Pi" https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/getting-started-with-minecraft-pi/

I'm having touble doing some things I wanted to do like installing Chromium and accessing the Raspbian GUI remotely. (I was using this tutorial: http://lifehacker.com/how-to-control-your-raspberry-pi-from-any-computer-usin-1788592777)

I got the remote Pi control going, but I can't get it to start automatically on boot up. I submitted this issue to the documentation: https://github.com/raspberrypi/documentation/issues/466

I see that my Canakit Micro SD included the Jessie distro of Raspbian. I'm going to try to upgrade the NOOBS to the newer version: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/

I also thought about just trying a Raspbian virtual machine.
